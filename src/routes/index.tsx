            <li>1. Enter your email address</li>
            <li>2. We'll send you a verification code</li>
            <li>
              3. Once you confirm the code, you can input your name & address to
              generate the email to send to the broker. We do not store this
              information
            </li>
            <li>4. We send the emails out</li>
            <li>
              5. Only your email address is stored, and is deleted after 45
              days. This is to ensure you don't send out multiple emails.
