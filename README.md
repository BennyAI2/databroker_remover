# Data Broker Removal Tool (Enhanced Fork)

This fork of [scoutantho/databroker_remover](https://github.com/scoutantho/databroker_remover) expands the original simple email generator into a fully self‑hostable application for handling GDPR/European personal data deletion requests.

It helps you generate, send and track deletion requests to data brokers and companies that process your personal data under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The app focuses on privacy: everything runs locally, with minimal data stored, and nothing is sent to third‑party services unless you configure it.

## Key features

- **Self‑hostable & Offline** – Run the tool on your own machine or server via Docker; no AWS or Vercel dependencies. Uses SQLite for storage and Redis for rate limiting.
- **EU‑focused** – Includes GDPR‑compliant email templates and filters brokers to EU jurisdictions. Defaults to a 45‑day retention period for data as required by law.
- **SMTP & IMAP support** – Use any SMTP server to send emails and an IMAP inbox to collect replies. A background poller ingests replies and stores them locally.
- **Reply‑to management** – Configure a fixed address, per‑user alias or per‑broker alias for the Reply‑To header so that responses don’t clutter your main inbox.
- **Tracking UI** – A built‑in web interface shows sent requests and received replies. You can read threads, see summaries and status labels (Completed, Needs ID, Not Found, etc.).
- **Settings UI** – Configure SMTP, IMAP, jurisdiction and AI settings from the web UI. No need to edit `.env` files after initial setup.
- **Local AI integration (optional)** – If enabled, the app uses [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to summarise replies and classify them by outcome. AI runs entirely on your hardware; no data leaves your machine.
- **Broker management** – An administration interface lets you view and edit the list of data brokers. You can also suggest new brokers by giving a URL; the AI helper extracts contact details for review.
- **Privacy‑first** – Only hashed or minimal data is stored. You control where data lives and when it gets deleted.

## Quick start

### 1. Clone and run with Docker

    git clone https://github.com/BennyAI2/databroker_remover.git
    cd databroker_remover
    cp .env.example .env    # customise as needed
    docker compose up -d --build

The stack includes:

- `web`: the SolidStart web app and API
- `redis`: used for rate limiting and background tasks
- `imap-poller`: service that polls your IMAP mailbox and stores replies
- `ollama`: local LLM server (only used if AI is enabled)
- `mailhog`: a fake SMTP server used for local development

Logs will show when the services are ready. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to open the UI.

### 2. Configure settings

Navigate to **Settings** in the web UI and enter your SMTP and IMAP credentials, default Reply‑To address, jurisdiction and AI options. These settings are persisted in SQLite and loaded by all services.

### 3. Add or import brokers

Go to **Brokers** to view the current list of data brokers. You can edit entries or click “Add via URL (AI)” to provide a privacy policy URL; the system will extract contact details and ask you to approve before saving.

### 4. Send requests

On the home page, enter your details (name, email, address, country) and select the brokers you want to contact. The app will generate GDPR‑compliant removal requests, set the correct Reply‑To and send them via your SMTP server. Each send is logged locally.

### 5. Track replies

The **Outbox** page lists all sent requests with a counter of replies. Click a request to see the full thread. If AI is enabled, each reply will have a short summary and a status label to help you quickly see what action (if any) is required.

## Advanced configuration

- **Jurisdiction and templates:** The default jurisdiction is “EU” and the tool uses GDPR‑focused templates. You can customise templates in the `emailTemplates` folder.
- **Reply‑To strategies:** Choose between `fixed`, `per_user` or `per_broker` in settings. Aliases are generated by appending `+alias` before the `@` in your reply address (e.g. `privacy+example@yourdomain.com`).
- **Data retention:** The retention period for hashed emails and logs defaults to 45 days; adjust this in settings.
- **AI models:** The tool uses Ollama models such as `llama3:8b-instruct`. You can select different models via settings. Ollama must be running locally for summaries to work.

## Privacy & security

This fork aims to minimise third‑party reliance. No personally identifiable information is sent to cloud services by default. You should still review and secure your mail server credentials and ensure your deployment complies with applicable laws.
